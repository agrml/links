## Motivation

Some belongings have too specific purposes, so we use them few times a year or even rarely.
Some of them cost more than a cup of coffee or waste a handful amount of nature resources.

Do we need all that stuff for individual use? Sometimes we don't. That give us the idea of **renting stuff**. If you're OK with that idea, have a look at https://arenter.ru/, I like their implementation.

I personally don't like renting stuff: too expensive or too shitty. But I'm OK with **sharing stuff**.

What do I mean? If I know you, I would lend you, say, a hiking backpack for free: you would not steal it and if you break it you would surely buy me a new one. 
You don't need to leave me a deposit, and you don't need to pay me. Except the belonging has a limited resource, and you used some of it.

## The list

**Repairs**

* hammer drill (ha-ha, the old one was borrowed and destroyed by a friend of mine, he gave me the money back and now it's the time for the new one to be shared)
* wiring detector
* building level
* torx
* other building tools

**Sport**

* cross-country skiing
* mountain bike
* scooter (самокат без мотора)
* hiking backpack 75l
* axe, saw
* portable gas-stove burner and a set of portable pans

**P.s. I hope you will also create a list like this**
