title: Stuff sharing
description: Let's save money and the planet

Some belongings have too specific purposes, so we use them few times a year or even rarely.
Some of them cost more than a cup of coffee or waste a handful amount of nature resources.

Do we need them for individual use? Sometime not. That give us the idea of renting. If you're OK with renting, have a look at https://arenter.ru/, I like their implementation.

I don't like **renting stuff**: it is expensive, or you condition of the stuff is bad. What leads us to idea of **sharing stuff**.
If I know you, I would lend you a hiking backpack for free: you would not steal it and if you break it you surely buy me a new one.
So you don't need to leave me a deposit, and you don't need to pay me. Except a chocolate bar for wearing out the backpack and a cup of coffee as a "thank you" :)

## The list

**Repairs**

* hammer drill (ha-ha, the old one was borrowed and destroyed by a friend of mine, I got money back and now it's time for the new one to be shared)
* wiring detector
* building level
* torx
* other building tools

**Sport**

* cross-country skiing
* mountain bike
* scooter (самокат без мотора)
* hiking backpack 75l
* axe, saw
* portable gas-stove burner and a set of portable pans

**P.s. I hope you will also create a list like this**
