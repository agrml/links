I'm a backend developer, based in Haifa, Israel. I'm originally from Moscow, Russia, and I love traveling, especially traveling untouched nature, especially traveling by car. 

Despite backend development on Python and Ruby (coming soon), I have some experience in management and UX. I develop product rather than close issues.
