## Stuff sharing

Some belongings have too specific purposes, so we use them few times a year or even rarely.
Some of them cost more than a cup of coffee or waste a handful amount of nature resources.

Do we need them for individual use? Sometime not. That give us the idea of renting. If you're OK with renting, have a look at https://arenter.ru/

I don't like **renting stuff**: it is expensive, or you condition of the stuff is bad. What leads us to idea of **sharing stuff**.
If I know you, I would lend you a hiking backpack for free: you would not steal it and if you break it you surely buy me a new one.
So you don't need to leave me a deposit, and you don't need to pay me. Except a chocolate bar for wearing out the backpack and a cup of coffee as a "thank you" :)

List of stuff I can lend (it would be easier in Russian, ha-ha):

**Ремонт**
– ударная дрель (ха-ха, прошлую товарищ вот так взял, сломал, вернул деньги и вот у меня новая)
– детектор проводки
– уровень
– всевозможные ручные инструменты

**Спорт**
– лыжи беговые (на рост 183, ботинки 46)
– велосипед mtb
– самокат
– походный рюкзак 75л
– трекинговые палки
– пила, топор
– газовая горелка и походный набор посуды готовить на ней
